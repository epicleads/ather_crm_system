## 🔄 Auto-Assign System

### Overview

The Auto-Assign to CRE feature automates the lead assignment process by automatically assigning new leads to selected CREs using a 1:1 round-robin distribution logic. This eliminates the need for manual drag-and-drop assignment in the Fresh Leads section.

### 🎯 Features

#### 1. Auto-Assign Toggle
- Each source bucket in the Assign Leads section has an "Auto-Assign" toggle button
- When activated, the toggle shows an active state with green background
- The configuration panel appears below the source bucket when auto-assign is enabled

#### 2. CRE Selection
- Multiple CREs can be selected for auto-assignment to each source
- CREs are displayed in a clean list format within the configuration panel
- Easy removal of CREs from the auto-assign list with a single click

#### 3. Round-Robin Distribution
- Leads are automatically distributed among selected CREs using 1:1 round-robin logic
- The system tracks the last assigned CRE for each source to ensure fair distribution
- New leads are automatically assigned when created if auto-assign is configured

#### 4. Configuration Management
- **Save Config**: Persists the auto-assign configuration to the database and immediately assigns existing unassigned leads
- **Auto-Assign Now**: Manually triggers auto-assignment for existing unassigned leads
- **Delete Config**: Removes the auto-assign configuration for a source
- **Add CRE**: Adds a new CRE to the auto-assign list with a modal selection interface
- **Visual Status**: Shows active auto-assign configuration with assigned CRE names

### 🔧 Enhanced Setup Instructions

#### 1. Enhanced Database Setup
Run the enhanced setup script to create all necessary database tables and functions:

```bash
python setup_enhanced_auto_assign.py
```

This will create:
- **auto_assign_count column** in `cre_users` table
- **auto_assign_history table** with IST timestamps
- **Fair distribution functions** and triggers
- **Statistics views** and monitoring functions

#### 2. Database Schema Overview

**Enhanced cre_users table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE cre_users 
ADD COLUMN auto_assign_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**New auto_assign_history table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE auto_assign_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    lead_uid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    assigned_cre_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    assigned_cre_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    cre_total_leads_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
    cre_total_leads_after INTEGER NOT NULL,
    assignment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'fair_distribution',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Kolkata'),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Kolkata')
);
```

**Key Features:**
- **IST Timezone Support**: All timestamps in Indian Standard Time (UTC+05:30)
- **Fair Distribution Tracking**: `auto_assign_count` tracks total assignments per CRE
- **Comprehensive History**: Complete audit trail of all assignments
- **Performance Optimized**: Indexes and triggers for efficient operation

#### 2. Background Trigger System
The system uses a **background trigger system** that automatically checks the `auto_assign_config` table every 30 seconds and assigns unassigned leads. This approach is:

- **Fully automatic** - No manual intervention needed
- **Real-time monitoring** - Checks every 30 seconds
- **Round-robin distribution** - Fair assignment among CREs
- **Error resilient** - Continues working even if individual assignments fail
- **Production ready** - Runs as a background daemon thread

## 🚀 Enhanced Features

### 🎯 Fair Distribution System

The enhanced auto-assign system now uses **fair distribution logic** based on assignment counts:

- **auto_assign_count column**: Tracks total leads assigned to each CRE
- **Fair distribution**: Prioritizes CREs with fewer assignments
- **Round-robin fallback**: Used when counts are equal
- **Real-time tracking**: Live updates with IST timestamps

### 📊 Live Progress Updates

The enhanced system provides **real-time terminal output** with detailed progress tracking:

```
🔄 Processing 20 unassigned leads for source 'META'
   📊 Current CRE distribution:
      • John CRE: 15 leads
      • Sarah CRE: 12 leads
      • Mike CRE: 18 leads
   📊 Progress: 5/20 leads assigned
   📊 Progress: 10/20 leads assigned
   📊 Progress: 15/20 leads assigned
   📊 Progress: 20/20 leads assigned
✅ Enhanced auto-assigned 20 leads for source 'META'
   📋 CRE Assignment Breakdown:
      • Sarah CRE: 8 leads (fair distribution)
      • John CRE: 7 leads (fair distribution)
      • Mike CRE: 5 leads (fair distribution)
   ✅ Excellent distribution: Variance = 3 leads
```

### 🎯 Fair Distribution Logic

The enhanced system now uses **fair distribution** instead of simple round-robin:

- **Priority-based**: CREs with fewer assignments get priority
- **Count tracking**: `auto_assign_count` tracks total assignments per CRE
- **Balanced distribution**: Ensures equal workload over time
- **Fallback mechanism**: Round-robin when counts are equal

#### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: 3 CREs with different counts**
```
John CRE: 15 leads
Sarah CRE: 12 leads  ← Gets next lead (lowest count)
Mike CRE: 18 leads
```

**Scenario 2: Equal counts (fallback to round-robin)**
```
John CRE: 10 leads
Sarah CRE: 10 leads  ← Round-robin order
Mike CRE: 10 leads
```

**Scenario 3: Multiple leads assignment**
```
Before: John(15), Sarah(12), Mike(18)
After:  John(16), Sarah(15), Mike(18)  ← Sarah got 3 leads
```

### 📊 Enhanced Statistics & History

The system now provides comprehensive tracking and statistics:

#### Real-time Statistics
```
📊 Enhanced Auto-Assign Summary: 20 leads assigned across all sources
📈 Enhanced Assignment Statistics:
   • META: 20 total assigned (Last: 14:30:25 IST)
   • GOOGLE: 15 total assigned (Last: 14:31:10 IST)

📊 Fair Distribution Statistics:
   📈 Total CREs: 3
   📊 Average assignments: 15.0
   📉 Min assignments: 12
   📈 Max assignments: 18
   📊 Variance: 6 leads
   ⚠️ Distribution needs improvement

   📋 CRE Priority (Fair Distribution Order):
      1. Sarah CRE: 12 leads 🎯 NEXT
      2. John CRE: 15 leads ⏳ WAITING
      3. Mike CRE: 18 leads ⏳ WAITING
```

#### History Tracking
The system maintains detailed history in `auto_assign_history` table:
- **Lead UID**: Unique identifier for each lead
- **Source**: Lead source (META, GOOGLE, etc.)
- **Assigned CRE**: Which CRE received the lead
- **Assignment Method**: Fair distribution or round-robin
- **IST Timestamp**: Indian Standard Time (UTC+05:30)
- **Count Tracking**: Before and after assignment counts

### How It Works

#### Enhanced Background Auto-Assign Trigger
The system runs every 30 seconds and automatically assigns unassigned leads using fair distribution:

1. **Checks auto_assign_config table** for configured sources
2. **Finds unassigned leads** for each configured source
3. **Uses fair distribution logic** based on `auto_assign_count`
4. **Logs assignments** to `auto_assign_history` with IST timestamps
5. **Provides live progress updates** every 5 leads
6. **Tracks distribution variance** and shows improvement metrics

#### Manual Trigger
You can manually trigger assignment for specific sources with fair distribution:

```python
from auto_assign_system import trigger_manual_assignment

# Trigger assignment for META source with fair distribution
assigned_count = trigger_manual_assignment("META")
print(f"Assigned {assigned_count} leads using fair distribution")
```

#### Enhanced Monitoring
Monitor the enhanced system with real-time statistics:

```bash
# Quick statistics
python enhanced_auto_assign_monitor.py --quick

# Continuous monitoring
python enhanced_auto_assign_monitor.py
```

SELECT * FROM auto_assign_config;

-- Check assigned leads
SELECT uid, cre_name, assigned, lead_status, source 
FROM lead_master 
WHERE assigned = 'Yes' 
ORDER BY cre_assigned_at DESC;
```

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

#### When Saving Config:
1. **Configuration saved** to `auto_assign_config` table
2. **Existing unassigned leads** immediately assigned
3. **Success message** shows assigned count
4. **UI updates** to show active configuration

#### Every Minute (GitHub Actions) / Continuous (Render):
1. **Checks** `auto_assign_config` table
2. **Finds** unassigned leads for configured sources
3. **Assigns** using round-robin logic
4. **Updates** `lead_status` to "Pending"
5. **Logs** assignment activity

#### In CRE Dashboard:
1. **Assigned leads** appear in "Fresh Leads" section
2. **Untouched subsection** shows newly assigned leads
3. **lead_status** = "Pending" for auto-assigned leads
4. **cre_name** shows assigned CRE

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Auto-Assign Not Working
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions logs
GitHub → Actions → Auto-Assign Trigger → View logs

# Check Render worker logs
Render Dashboard → auto-assign-worker → Logs

# Verify database config
SELECT * FROM auto_assign_config;
```

#### 2. Leads Not Appearing in Fresh Leads

-- Check lead assignment
SELECT uid, cre_name, assigned, lead_status 
FROM lead_master 
WHERE source = 'YourSource' 
ORDER BY cre_assigned_at DESC;
```

#### 3. Render Worker Not Starting
```bash
# Check render.yaml syntax
# Verify environment variables
# Check worker logs in Render dashboard
```

#### 4. Terminal shows incorrect counts
**Solution**: The enhanced system now provides accurate real-time counts with progress updates every 5 leads.
